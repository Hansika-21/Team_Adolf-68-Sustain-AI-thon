# Food Donation and Redistribution Platform in Tamil Nadu

## Brief Introduction
The Food Donation and Redistribution Platform is a mobile application aimed at reducing food waste and alleviating hunger in Tamil Nadu. The platform connects food donors, such as hotels and caterers, with trusts, NGOs, and shelters in need of surplus food. By ensuring real-time communication, efficient logistics, and adherence to food safety standards, the project seeks to bridge the gap between excess food and underprivileged communities. This initiative also aligns with multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including *Zero Hunger, **No Poverty, and **Responsible Consumption and Production*.
